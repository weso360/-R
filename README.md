# Keylogger for Educational Cybersecurity Research/Project

**Purpose:**

This Python code implements a basic keylogger designed for educational cybersecurity purposes. It demonstrates how keyloggers function and can be used to monitor and collect user input for various security-related activities.

**Scope:**

- Captures keystrokes, excluding Shift and Space keys.
- Logs mouse clicks and release events, including positions.
- Monitors clipboard changes.
- Configurable idle time threshold before logging events.


- **Keyloggers can be valuable tools for security assessments, penetration testing, and malware analysis.**
- **Utilize keyloggers responsibly, always prioritizing privacy and legal compliance.**
  

**Educational Benefits:**

- Understanding keylogger functionality enhances threat awareness and defensive strategies (My Next ProjectðŸ¤ž).
- Hands-on experience with keyloggers can improve incident response and forensic analysis skills.

**Code Usage:**

1. Ensure Python is installed with required libraries: `pynput`, `keyboard`, `mouse`, `clipboard`, and `time`.
2. Run the code from the command line: `python/python3 script.py` (replace with your file name).
3. Observe logged events in the console.
4. Terminate the program using Ctrl+C or closing the terminal window.

**Remember:**

- Exercise caution and respect privacy when working with keyloggers.
- Prioritize ethical and responsible use in cybersecurity practices.
